# artisanal-and-small-mining-detection
Project to detect artisanal and small scale mining with open access satellite imageray.

## Alpha version
Nothing starts of perfect. The frist step to a detection system is data.
#### IPIS visualization of small and artisanal mining sites
The lists data points from [ipis-data](https://ipisresearch-dashboard.shinyapps.io/open_data_app/) (downloaded March 2021) in form of black dots.
The dots can be klicked on, upon which a time series is visualized.

The App builds upon [Justin Braatens](https://github.com/jdbcode) rgb-timeseries Google Earth Engine App.
Next step: Inlcude time stamp filter mechanism. Goal: _Visualize_ the creation of an artisanal mining area in form of a time series
 

## Project outline
The project is ongoing, open source (exact licence to be determined) and encourages everyone to participate. This is a very early stage of the project.  Because of the interest of the ”founder” a technical feasibility study is of interest right now.  The feasibility study validates whether artisanal and small scale mining can be detect with satellite imagery.
#### Draft of the project phases
1. Create a curated dataset. [currently]
2. Create a detection model.
3. Figuring out how people, institutions, government branches, NGOs can create value with the detection model.

## Participation opportunities
There  are  a  lot  of  unanswered  questions.  Feel  free  to  post  any  notes  and  questions  under issues. Do You now how cloud-based GIS systems are used? Are You a member of a local monitoring authority? Do You curate data sets?
